# movableobjects

A database system that stores and manages the properties of moving objects, such as position, velocity, and direction of movement, is known as a moving object database (MOD).
This type of database is extensively utilized in various sectors, including transportation, logistics, travel and tourism, military operations, and mobile communications. MOD enables effective analysis and querying of historical and real-time movements of objects. Data structures and models representing the temporal and spatial dimensions of moving objects, spatial and/or temporal indexing techniques, query processing algorithms, and data update management are all components of MOD.


 Main reasons why moving object databases are needed 

1 Massive moving object data
Big data that can’t fit in the main memory has to be stored on a disk based system, hence MODB’s are required for this operations.


2 Spatial and temporal queries
Spatial queries such as intersection and K-Nearest neighbor could be executed in these systems, making them supeior to the classical database systems.

3 Performance and Scalability 
Since MODB’s are using spatial indexing to store the location data of moving objects they provide better performance compared to the classical database structures.


4 Data integrity and security
Mobile databases help еnsure the accuracy and integrity of mobile data and provide the necessary mechanisms to meet data security and privacy requirements.


5 Heterogeneous data sources
The location based data from the IoT devices could be stored on a MODB


6 Future predictions and simulations
Moving Objects Databases could be used for big loads of future predictions and simulations since MODBs use efficient spatial indexing and disks to operate, they can store the data that can’t fit in the memory.
